Please install composer on your system to download all required composer repositories, like the Vendor folder (run all commands in root directory):
> composer install
You can download composer here:
https://getcomposer.org/download/<br>

If you running into this problem:<br>
*'Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.'*<br>
Add the following line to your **php.ini** file:
> extension=php_fileinfo.dll

Then, the file should look like this:
> ;extension=pdo_sqlite<br>
;extension=pgsql<br>
extension=php_fileinfo.dll<br>
;extension=shmop

Now, please **install the required node_modules via npm**:
> npm install

The backend is set up with Laravel.<br>
Before starting the development server please make sure you **rename the .env_local file to .env**.<br>
For safety the original .env file won't be committed into any repository.

Laravel has an integrated **web server** (Artisan) that can be started with this command:
> php artisan serve

To start the watcher for the frontend, you can use:
> npm run watch

In this project, I use the PHP framework Laravel with the MVC pattern for the backend.<br>
This includes all logic needed for handling the csv import and export.<br>
Laravel is not necessary for this project but I decided to set it up because I want to go more into it.<br>Moreover, I always have some experience with Symphony, that also operates after the MVC pattern.<br>
For the frontend I use Vue.js, I already have experiences with it.<br>

If you have questions please don't hesitate to contact me:<br>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
